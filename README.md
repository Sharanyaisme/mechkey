This project is my complete journey of making a custom mechanical keyboard right from scratch where I designed the PCB, created the 3D model of the case, aligned all the switches, added the stabilizers and finally assembled it into a proper working setup. I started by understanding the layout I wanted and then carefully designed the PCB, routing every trace manually and adding silkscreen markings so that each component position is clearly understood during assembly. This part taught me how tiny electrical details make a big difference in functionality. After the PCB was ready, I moved to CAD where I modelled the outer case, added proper tolerances, aligned the switch cutouts and provided space for the USB port and stabilizers so that the build feels solid and gives proper typing comfort.

Once the model looked correct, I placed all the switches virtually to visualise how it will look after manufacturing and it gave me so much motivation because it started looking like a real product. Then I began preparing the BOM where I listed all the parts like switches, screws, microcontroller, stabilizers, PCB components and mounting hardware so anyone can understand what is needed to build this keyboard. After this I wrote the final readme explaining the journey, design process, assembly steps and technical notes in a simple way so others can follow it too. Finally I assembled everything and when I saw all switches neatly sitting inside the case, it really felt like a proper keyboard made fully by me. This project not only taught me electronics and CAD but also patience, planning and how a simple idea slowly turns into something real and beautiful.
